Dedicated Web Analyst with over 2.5 years of experience in the field. I've had the privilege of immersing myself in the world of digital analytics, where I've focused on optimizing web tracking mechanisms and offering guidance on effective tag management practices.

ðŸ“Š In my role as a web analyst, I've had the opportunity to work with various tracking codes and analytics using GA4. My responsibilities have extended beyond tracking, as I've assisted in troubleshooting website-related issues and ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations. I've also been fortunate to lead projects involving offline conversion imports and leveraging GA4 BigQuery export for enhanced analysis.

ðŸ”— I've had the opportunity to work on both client-side and server-side implementations of Google Tag Manager, including multidomain and cross-domain setup. These experiences have taught me the importance of adaptability and continuous learning.

ðŸ’» My journey has led me to explore the realm of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), where I've navigated tools like BigQuery and Dataform to extract insights. Through ETL tasks for clients, I've contributed to warehousing and BI reporting solutions. Additionally, I've gained proficiency in Google Looker Studio for reporting functionalities.

ðŸ“ˆ Beyond analytics, I've delved into Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) and developed models showcased in my diploma thesis, utilizing Python and R. My journey is marked by a commitment to learning and growth.

âš½ Outside of work, I find joy in sports like football, swimming, and cycling. Currently, I'm exploring system design and frontend development with Svelte, as I undertake the challenge of building my own blog. 

ðŸ“š In my downtime, I enjoy philosophical discussions and immersing myself in captivating books. Music is another passion of mine, with artists like Radiohead, James Blake, and Michael Kiwanuka resonating with me. And of course, I have a soft spot for dogs, delectable burgers, and the soulful melodies of Max Richter's "Four Seasons."

ðŸŒŸ I'm always eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities for collaboration. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to engage in meaningful conversations and learn from your experiences.
