# Who Am I?

**_Web Analyst:_** My primary focus in on Google Analytics 4 (GA4) & Google Tag Manager (GTM). I have no problem using other tracking mechanisms and I am able to recreate the whole tracking architecture with my own backend. I am no stranger to server-side tracking and modern solutions which can help you get the most accurate data possible. 

**_Marketing Analyst:_** Buidling marketing dashboards including Extraction, Transformation and Loading (ETL) of data to comprehensive dashboards. I manage these flows primarily in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and present final reports in Google Looker Studio. I have also implemented numerous Reverse-ETL jobs concerning enrichment of data in marketing platforms - the perfect example of this is Offline Conversion Import using both 1st party identifiers and/or cookies.

**_Marketing Data Scientist:_** Experience using most MMM and Causal Inference frameworks (Robyn, Lightweight MMM, Orbit, PyMC Marketing, CausalPy, CausalImpact, GeoLift, ...). I have also developed my own models for purposes of my Diploma thesis.

**_Life-long learner:_** I consume a lot of news and articles related to web tracking and marketing measurement. I studied econometrics and I am eager to learn anything that could help optimize digital marketing activities.
